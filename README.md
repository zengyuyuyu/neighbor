# Exploring Neighbor Spatial Relationships for Enhanced Lumbar Vertebrae Detection in X-ray Images
We propose a novel approach to enhance vertebrae detection accuracy by exploiting both global and local spatial relationships between neighboring vertebrae. 

We conduct extensive experiments on two lumbar spine datasets.
1. CM Spine Dataset. We use a mobile dual-mode G-arm X-ray machine (Geelin500-A) to collect 208 1024 * 1024 lumbar spine X-ray anterior view images during surgical procedures. (Available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r9wX1802gkU4-EQHMMlyAlEiWXGWLhhJ/view?usp=drive_link)
2. BUU Spine Dataset. The Burapha Spine Dataset version 0.1 is a publicly available dataset of lumbar spine X-ray images. (Available at: https://services.informatics.buu.ac.th/spine/)
